# Discord RSS Bot

First experiment with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and an [rss-feed-emitter](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/rss-feed-emitter) library.

## Modularity

Allows you to easily add new modules to this bot or integrate some modules into your own :)

## Usage

add .env file with your BOT_Token

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Disclaimer

I'm using a lot of comment to let beginners understand the code and explain some Javascript features.
While I have some expirience in JS I'd consider myself as a complete beginner to nodeJS and especially discord.js.
Saying that this project might not be a reference for code quality since I'm not aware of best practices & anti patterns regarding discord and node.
